      <dt>Aerobic Conditioning</dt>
      <dd>
        Training that improves endurance. Used to refer to running or other
        exercise at an intensity that's sufficiently easy for your respiratory
        and cardiovascular systems to deliver all or most of the oxygen required
        by your muscles, and slow enough that lactic acid doesn't appreciably
        build up in your muscles. Generally, you can sustain a slow aerobic pace
        for long periods of time, provided you have the endurance to go long
        distances.
      </dd>
      <dt>Bandit</dt>
      <dd>
        A bandit is one who runs an official road race without officially
        registering for the event or paying registration fees. Bandits are
        popular in large races that sell out fast, and are generally frowned
        upon by the running community. While banditing may appear innocent at
        first, a bandit may actually end up taking resources from registered
        runners, from water to race medals to even the attention of emergency
        medical staff.
      </dd>
      <dt>C25K</dt>
      <dd>
        Acronym for couch to 5K, a beginner training plan to take non-runners
        from "the couch" to running their first 5K.
      </dd>
      <dt>DNF</dt>
      <dd>
        "Did not finish." This can be due to pulling yourself out of a race, or
        simply not finishing in a designated course time.
      </dd>
      <dt>Easy Run</dt>
      <dd>A slow run done at a conversational pace.</dd>
